# SFML-minGW-VSCode-StaticLib-OneClick-Configuration2
Hi everyone! i upload this repository as a backup of this "journey" :,D. Ok...well...i should be thinking, "What did you do?", for can you understand  keep in mind that... i was 4 days without sleep, for this problem, because i am patiente and capricious. I had a problem with the library SFML for c++. This library in principle doesnt run with Visual Studio Code, and usually it is installed in Visual Studio Community. Well... i dont like this last :)...So decided modifycate the VSC to run this beautifull library. And i couldnÂ´t. But after of 4 days without sleep i get the solution :D. Basically y modificate the c++ json configuration to integrate the files of the library, and second problem i was... The button of run code didnt run the .exe. So i modificated too. And now i have the complete integration of this library with my VSCode. take it like a template for projects with SFML.
